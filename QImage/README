    The QImage class provides a hardware-independent image representation that allows
direct access to the pixel data, and can be used as a paint device.
    Because QImage is a QPaintDevice subclass, QPainter can be used to draw directly onto
images. When using QPainter on a QImage, the painting can be performed in another thread
than the current GUI thread.
    The QImage class supports several image formats described by the Format enum. These
include monochrome, 8-bit, 32-bit and alpha-blended images which are available in all versions
of Qt 4.x.

    QImage类提供独立于硬件的图片，允许修改像素点数据，可以当做绘图设备使用。
    因为QImage是QPaintDevice的子类，QPainter可以直接在图片上绘图，当在QImage
中直接使用QPainter，绘图可以在当前的GUI线程之外进行绘图。
    QImage类支持一些格式描述，使用Format提供的枚举。
